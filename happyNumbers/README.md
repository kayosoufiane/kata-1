###Happy Numbers

Java Code by Oliver Jahns und Katharina Laube

Written during the [Softwerkskammer Magdeburg Meeting @ selectline] 
(https://www.softwerkskammer.org/activities/magdeburg_treffen_21)

Runs with *JUnit 4.11* and *JUnitParams 1.0.4* as testing framework.

**Business Requirements**
Write a function that calculates if a number is happy or not.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: 
A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. 

**Task**
Find and print the happy numbers between 10 and 20.
